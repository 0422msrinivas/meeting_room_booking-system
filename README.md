# Meeting Room Booking System

A simple command-line based meeting room booking system implemented in Python. This system allows users to sign up, log in, create, read, update, and delete bookings for meeting rooms. It also includes features like password hashing, email notifications, and OTP-based password reset.

## Features

Sure! Here's a more detailed description of how the Meeting Room Booking System works:

 User Authentication:
- Sign Up: Users can create a new account by providing a username, password, and email. The password is securely hashed using the bcrypt library before storing it in the database.
- Log In: Registered users can log in securely using their username and password. Password comparison is done by hashing the provided password and comparing it with the stored hashed password.

 Booking Management:
- Create Booking: Logged-in users can create a booking for a meeting room by specifying the room name, start time, and end time. The system ensures that the booking time is in the future and that the end time is after the start time. If the selected room is already booked for the given time slot, the system removes the room from the available options.
- Read Bookings: Users can view their existing bookings, including details such as room name, start time, and end time.
- Update Booking: Users can update an existing booking by specifying the index of the booking to be updated, along with the new room, start time, and end time. The system performs validation to ensure that the new time slot is available and valid.
- Delete Booking: Users can delete a booking by specifying the index of the booking to be deleted. The room associated with the deleted booking is added back to the available rooms.

 Password Security:
- User passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt library before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.
- Passwords are also salted, adding an additional layer of security to protect against dictionary and rainbow table attacks.

 Email Notifications:
- Users receive email notifications for booking confirmation and password reset OTP.
- When a user creates or updates a booking, a confirmation email is sent to their registered email address.
- Password reset functionality allows users to request a one-time password (OTP) to reset their password. The OTP is sent to the user's registered email address.

 Input Validation:
- The system performs input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent errors. It checks for valid email formats, proper date-time formats, and valid user input during booking creation and update.

 Requirements:
- The system requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries: `bcrypt`, `smtplib`, `email`, `datetime`.

This system provides a simple and effective way for users to manage meeting room bookings securely. It incorporates essential features like user authentication, booking management, password security, email notifications, and input validation to create a robust and reliable solution for organizing meetings and appointments.
- Input Validation: Proper validation is performed on user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
